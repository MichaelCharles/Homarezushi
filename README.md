# Homarezushi Restaurant

This is a restaurant website that I'm working on for Homarezushi in Akita, Japan. They need something quickly, and as my backend skills aren't quite up to snuff yet, I'm trying to do everything on the client side. I've chosen to use jQuery to reader the html files in the ```views``` folders as a way to try to handle the content in a somewhat modern way.
